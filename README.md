# Project_2

This app was created to explore the Seoul Bike Sharing Demand Prediction data set. The data, from Kaggle,
was collected in order to try to predict how weather affects the number of bikes used by a bike sharing 
company in Seoul, South Korea. The data set has 14 variables, containing the number of bikes rented during a 
particular hour on a particular day and information on the weather at the time and other circumstances. In 
this app, a user can explore associations between numeric variables, subset the data by categorical and numeric 
variables, and download the subsetted data.
